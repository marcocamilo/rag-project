# What is RAG? An Overview
- RAG systems leverage external knowledge sources to enhance the accuracy, relevance, and coherence of generated text, addressing the limitations of purely parametric memory in traditional language models. ([Lewis et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401))

- Component of a RAG System:
  * **Retrieval**: searches through vast knowledge bases to identify the most pertinent information based on the input query or context.
    + *sparse retrieval*: utilizes inverted indexes and term-based matching.
    + *dense retrieval*: employs dense vector representations.
    + *semantic similarity*: employed to optimize the retrieval process.
  * **Generation**: combines the query and the retrieved context into a coherent and fluent response.
